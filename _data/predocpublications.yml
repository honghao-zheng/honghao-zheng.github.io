   #  abstract: We study how economies with distinct development phases can preferably curtail emissions by exploiting unique variations of heterogeneous regulations—absolute- and intensity-type emission regulations in the context of carbon emission trading schemes (ETS) in China. Using an extensive array of rich data, we employ a difference-in-differences empirical strategy to examine the behaviors of all primary margins of adjustment to ETS from the demand to the supply side of energy. We find that, under imperfect markets and incomplete regulation, both types of ETS can induce carbon mitigation but with distinct tradeoffs. Aggregate impacts suggest overall annual reductions in energy consumption by 23% and 9% of yearly energy consumption in ETS with absolute- and intensity-type emission regulations, respectively.
