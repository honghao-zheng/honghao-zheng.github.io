    abstract: I examine the effects of buyer power on the organization of production in the Chinese coal mining industry. I show how buyer power emanating from downstream coal-fired power plants ultimately affects the production-safety tradeoff of upstream coal mines. I estimate a structural model of coal mines in imperfect output markets featuring (i) joint production of coal and worker safety as outputs, and (ii) choosing where to locate on the production-safety frontier via endogenous safety choices and factor-augmenting productivity. To identify causal effects, I employ a shift-share instrumental variable, leveraging exogenous variations in buyer power exposure stemming from an electricity sector restructuring and other demand-side shocks. The results show that an increase in buyer power significantly reduces future coal mine productivity, with heterogeneous impacts on Hicks-neutral and labor-augmenting productivity. Buyer power exposure leads to higher provincial death rates, which are also corroborated by lower composite coal outputs and safety at the mine level. Further evidence indicates exposure of coal mines to buyer power prompts a shift toward less capital-intensive, more traditional, and less safe mining technologies. Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that the decline in buyer power accounts for 60% of the improvement in coal mining death rates.

    abstract: We study how economies with distinct development phases can preferably curtail emissions by exploiting unique variations of heterogeneous regulations—absolute- and intensity-type emission regulations in the context of carbon emission trading schemes (ETS) in China. Using an extensive array of rich data, we employ a difference-in-differences empirical strategy to examine the behaviors of all primary margins of adjustment to ETS from the demand to the supply side of energy. We find that, under imperfect markets and incomplete regulation, both types of ETS can induce carbon mitigation but with distinct tradeoffs. Aggregate impacts suggest overall annual reductions in energy consumption by 23% and 9% of yearly energy consumption in ETS with absolute- and intensity-type emission regulations, respectively.

  #   abstract: I examine how risk aversion affects firms’ foreign direct investment (FDI) entry dynamics when facing uncertainty. To do so, I introduce risk aversion into a two-period dynamic model, in which firms are uncertain about their foreign profitability before learning it by operating in each foreign market. The introduction of risk aversion enables me to more comprehensively reveal the real drivers of firms’ entry dynamics in different scenarios compared to previous literature. I show that, conditional on the FDI entry, risk aversion and market-specific uncertainty increase firms’ tendency to engage in sequential FDI, i.e., conducting exporting trials before the FDI entry. The main theoretical predictions of the model are corroborated by empirical evidence on Chineses outward FDI at the firm-level.
