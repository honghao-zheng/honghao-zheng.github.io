  #   # abstract: This paper evaluates the eﬀectiveness of both absolute- and intensity-type emission regulations in the context of carbon emission trading schemes (ETS) in China. The variation of heterogeneous regulations provides an exceptional opportunity to study how distinct phase economies can curtail emissions preferably. We employ a diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences empirical strategy to examine the behaviors of all margins of adjustment to ETS from energy consumption to power supply. We ﬁnd that, under imperfect markets and incomplete regulation, both types of ETS can induce carbon mitigation but with distinct tradeoﬀs. Aggregate impacts suggest overall annual reductions in energy consumption of 751×10<sup>4</sup>  and 866×10<sup>4</sup> tons of standard coal equivalent, or 9% and 23% of yearly energy consumption in ETS with absolute- and intensity-type emission regulations, respectively.

    abstract: We examine the effects of demand uncertainty on productivity and technological adoption in the German coal mining industry, utilizing a unique demand-smoothing policy with downstream steel sector. We conduct a difference-in-differences investigation exploiting variations in coal mines' suitability to produce coke as input for downstream steel production. We estimate that demand certainty increases productivity by up to 10% and the share of mechanized production by 10 percentage points. Relying on a direct measure of demand uncertainty—canceled worker shifts due to insufficient demand, we find the policy significantly reduces coal mines' demand uncertainty.

    # notes: Extended Abstract
    abstract: We study the consequences of market power on both consumer surplus and environmental benefits in China's cement industry, where collusive producer behavior is frequently alleged. We develop a structural framework combining demand and production approaches to identify unobserved conduct. Using the estimated structural parameters, we quantify the unintended environmental benefits of collusion and design corresponding environmental policies conditional on different objective functions of the government.

    # notes: Extended Abstract
    abstract: We estimate the impact of credit access on labor market power considering capital-skill complementarity, by investigating an intangible collateral reform in Norway. We take advantage of a wide range of novel Norwegian data regarding household tax returns, employer-employee relationships, firm-bank loan information, and firm balance sheets, along with a production function approach, to estimate heterogeneous labor market power over high- and low-skilled labor. The idea is to understand how imperfections in capital and labor input markets are related.

  #   abstract: I examine how risk aversion affects firms’ foreign direct investment (FDI) entry dynamics when facing uncertainty. To do so, I introduce risk aversion into a two-period dynamic model, in which firms are uncertain about their foreign profitability before learning it by operating in each foreign market. The introduction of risk aversion enables me to more comprehensively reveal the real drivers of firms’ entry dynamics in different scenarios compared to previous literature. I show that, conditional on the FDI entry, risk aversion and market-specific uncertainty increase firms’ tendency to engage in sequential FDI, i.e., conducting exporting trials before the FDI entry. The main theoretical predictions of the model are corroborated by empirical evidence on Chineses outward FDI at the firm-level.
