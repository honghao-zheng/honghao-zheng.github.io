## About Me

I'm a fifth-year PhD candidate in Economics at KU Leuven <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/ioleuven/home" target="_blank">(IO@Leuven)</a>.

I study how Ô¨Årms behave and operate in imperfect factor and product markets and the resulting effects.

In the Spring of 2024, I was a visiting scholar at the Department of Economics of <a href="https://econ.duke.edu/" target="_blank">Duke University</a>.

## Research Interests

- **Empirical Industrial Organization:** Market Power, Productivity, and Production Function Estimation
- **Environmental/Energy Economics:** Emission Trading Schemes and Production-Emission Tradeoff
- **International Economics:** Trade Dynamics, FDI Entry, and Uncertainty
